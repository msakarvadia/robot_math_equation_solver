Use a turtlebot + arm + camera to recognize handwritten math equations and write the answer on a whiteboard


Project Description: Describe the goal of your project, why it's interesting, what you were able to make your robot do, and what the main components of your project are and how they fit together - please include diagrams and gifs when appropriate

System Architecture: Describe in detail the robotics algorithm you implemented and each major component of your project, highlight what pieces of code contribute to these main components

ROS Node Diagram: Please include a visual diagram representing all of the ROS nodes, ROS topics, and publisher/subscriber connections present in your final project.

Execution: Describe how to run your code, e.g., step-by-step instructions on what commands to run in each terminal window to execute your project code.

Challenges, Future Work, and Takeaways: These should take a similar form and structure to how you approached these in the previous projects (1 paragraph each for the challenges and future work and a few bullet points for takeaways)
